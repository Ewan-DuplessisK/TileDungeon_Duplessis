Multiple bugs that I couldn't solve because they were entangled 


The display is only partial and what's display is not behaving like it should


The movement inputs are computed twice


I couldn't get the SLD inputs to work, so the game is controlled via zqsd in console


The console display broke too at some point, you will find the actual positions of the actor in map.png


I'm very sorry of the state I'm delivering this, but I'm stuck.
